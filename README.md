# AnimalHunt

## Getting started

Animal Hunt is a conversational game inspired in ZORK.

In this game, your main goal will be to hunt animals and get furs, skins and feathers to pay a debt that you have with the bank.
To win, you have to attack the animals (using a weapon is reccomended), kill them, loot them and give the items to the bank.
If you die during a combat, the game is over.
There is also a magic fountain where you can swim and recover your hit-points.

There are some commands that you will need to know in order to play the game:

- help - Shows the commands that you can use to play Animal Hunt
- go (direction) - Move the player to the given direction
- take (item) - Take an item from the room or inventory
- drop (item) - Drop an item from inventory
- put (item, container) - Put an item inside a container
- look (place) - Look into a place to know which items or creatures are there
- attack (target) - Attack an animal in order to hunt it
- stats - Shows the player stats (HP, attack and protection)
- equip - Lets you equip a weapon or another object from your inventory
- unequip - Lets you unequip a weapon or another object
- examine (target) - Shows stats and objects that belong to an animal
- loot (target) - Takes all the objects that belong to an animal
- inventory - Shows all the objects that belong to you
- swim - If you are on the magic fountain, yo can recover HP
- quit - Closes the game

## Ideas not finished
- Having a store where you can buy weapons and armours and sell items to earn money.
- Use money to pay the debt to the bank.
- Having a wallet that you can open to know how much money you have.
- Having a church where you can pray and donate money to be more lucky (reduced prices in the store, more attack points and better weapons on the map).
